I am first year PhD student in [School of Artifical Intelligence](https://scai.iitd.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://iitd.ac.in/), co-advised by [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/). I graduated with BTech in Textile Technology and MTech in Computer Science Engineering from Indian [Institute of Technoloy Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in). I was fortunate to advised by Parag Singla during my master.  
I am broadly interested in human centric machine learning. I belive that a way to build generalized artificial intelligence is to make use of human centric biases. One of the problem towards human centric AI is how to segrregate the dense neural information in meaning full representation aka [binding problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05208). I have been working on object centric binding problem. I also plan to work on human centric RL.
