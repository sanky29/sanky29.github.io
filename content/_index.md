I am a first-year PhD student in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.iitd.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi]((https://iitd.ac.in/)), co-advised by [Parag Singla](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~parags/) and [Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/). I graduated with a BTech in Textile Technology and an MTech in Computer Science Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in). I was fortunate to be advised by Parag Singla during my master's.  
I am broadly interested in human-centric machine learning. I believe that a way to build generalized artificial intelligence is to make use of human-centric biases. One of the problems towards human-centric AI is how to segregate the dense neural information in meaningful full representation aka binding problem. I have been working on an object-centric [binding problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05208). I also plan to work on human-centric RL.
